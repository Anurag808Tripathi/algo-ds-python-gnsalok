# Algorithms and Data Structure

In this repository Python3 is used to impletement the solutions.

## Prerequisite
You should have basic understanding of Python. 
* [Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction) - Python Google Developers

### Downloading and Installing
* [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python 
* [Set env. variable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyOHCTgWpg) - Alok Tripathi

## Implemented Solutions
* Loops and Recursion
* Arrays and Matrices
* Linked Lists
* Queues
* Stacks
* Heaps
* Sets and Hash Maps
* Trees
* Binary Search
* Graphs
* DFS, BFS, and Backtracking
* Tries
* Merge sort and quick sort

## Other Important Problems for Interview 
* Dynamic Programming (Memoization and Divide-and-Conquer)
* Problems with Multiple Pointers or Sliding Windows
* Greedy Algorithms
* Logical/Mathematical proof techniques (contradiction, contrapositive, induction, cases),
* Object Oriented Programming (I recommend checking out Clean Code by Robert Martin, especially the sections on Single Responsibility Principle. Not SUPER important for interviews, but very good to know).
